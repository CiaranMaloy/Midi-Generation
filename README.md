## Project Overview

TODO 

## Key Features

Project aims to use modern machine learning techniques to deliver: 
1. For a given input midi file, a complementary midi file will be returned
2. This returned midi file will be either a set of chords, or a lead melody

## Project Structure

Outline the structure of the project, including important directories, files, and their purposes.

## Timeline

Provide a timeline for the project, highlighting milestones and deadlines.

- **Phase 1: December 2023**
  - Task 1 - create project website (done)
  - Task 2 - include functionality to upload a midi file (done)
  - Task 3 - include functionality that allows the download of a midi file (done)
  - Task 4 - include functionality where there is some alteration/transposition of the midi file before download 
  - Task 4 - settle on a modern ML technique to generate a useful midi output

- **Phase 2: January 2023**
  - Task 1 - Have working 1st iteration of midi generation algorithm
  - Task 2
  - ...

## Milestones 
### Milestone 1 (todo)
Have a working website that a user uploads a midi file to, and is given an option to download a reversed version of that midi file.
